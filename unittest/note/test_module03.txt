We are testing a custom function called add() with the assertEqual() method.
Method assertEqual() takes two arguments and determines if both arguments are equal.
If both arguments are equal, the test case passes; otherwise, it fails.
We have also written a function called add() in the same test module thatâ€™s not a member
of the test class. With test_case01() and test_case03(), we are testing the correctness
of the function.
