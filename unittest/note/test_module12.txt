Skipping tests conditionally and unconditionally:
Decorators for implementing the skipping mechanism in unittest:

* unittest.skip(reason): Unconditionally skips the decorated test.
reason should describe why the test is being skipped.

* unittest.skipIf(condition, reason): Skips the decorated test if
condition is true.

* unittest.skipUnless(condition, reason): Skips the decorated
test unless condition is true.

* unittest.expectedFailure(): Marks the test as an expected failure.
If the test fails when it runs, the test is not counted as a failure.
